# Aggie Event
School life is all about the college experience. We established a website platform to introduce the wide variety of on-campus events and resources for freshmen and transfer residential students. We want new Aggies get the best college experience during their residency on campus. Therefore, it is important to spread fun and updated school events to them on a more organized website. Students can explore their interested and opportunities on this website and scheduled events into their calendar. Events are categorized in different ways such as locations and event types  so students can navigate them in more convenient and organized way.


## Our Inspiration
Student events and residential life are essential for first-year students' college experience. Many first-year students including freshmen and transfers choose to live in residence halls and on-campus housing because they want to enrich their college experience. As a marketing assistant working at the UC Davis Student Housing and Dining Service Department, I noticed that the promotion of school activities and events for new Aggies is lacking. Many new students struggle to navigate school events and special activities since information on social media is scattered around and it can be overwhelming. On-campus events such as Chef Challenge, and Reopening of the GunRock Pub are spread through Instagram, Facebook, or flyers, but the spread isn't as effective as imagined since there are still many new students that are unaware of those events. Therefore, we want to build a platform that provides a more convenient search for on-campus school events.
## What does it offer
Our target audience is mainly focused on on-campus residential students, including freshman, second-year, and transfer students. Users can use this website to navigate school events and explore new organizations that they are unaware of before. Users will log in with their school ID and password so the webpage can provide more personalization options on event selections. Users can search up different events that are happening on-campus, categorized in different ways such as location, event types, target audience, dates, and prices. Users can click into each event module to view event details. To schedule an event into their calendar, simply select "Yes" on the question "Are You Going," the event will automatically be added to the user's schedule. Users can cancel the scheduled event simply by selecting "No."
## How we build it
To begin this project, our designer planned all the layout and design on Figma. We studied the school branding color and type font because we want to make this website dedicated to the UC Davis Student Housing and Dining Service Department. We also researched school events for images and information to make the website more authentic and reliable. Next, our coders use React to compose each webpage as components and merge them to build our website prototype.

## Challenges we ran into
None of us are familiar with using react and javascript, as this project is also a difficult learning experience for us. 

Mona, one of the coders says "When I was working on the Navbar, I did not know how to route multiple web pages to react. It took me a whole afternoon to learn how to install dependencies like styled-components and router dom to connect these web pages together. " 

Yuxin Ren, our next coder says "Though three of us are in C.S. major none of us is familiar with front-end developing or cooperating with each other in a project like this. There are lots of technical challenges we need to solve and learn. However, as we only have 24 hours to solve them, we can't walk through the whole learning path of it. We are forced to jump into applying them just by looking at some example codes. There are lots of concepts we have no idea, thus there are lots of issues that we have no idea how to fix." 

Yunkun Tang, our third coder says, "When we started the project since all of us did not have much experience in web programming, we had to keep searching and construct each individual page with great effort, which provides us with the opportunity to learn more concepts and methods about frontend programming. I believe that we have tried our best and received the best result we could achieve within the time limit."

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we have accomplished so far! This 24-hour window is such an exciting and memorable time that we will remember forever. We believed that this website will be a very helpful tool for new students at UC Davis. This platform will truly levitate UC Davis students' college experience and we are so excited about what this could turn out to be in the future.

## What's next for Aggie Events 
We are planning to implement the backend with express.js and database with mongodb. We also want to query if there are existing APIs or Frameworks to that sends weekly event update to our subscribers.

## TestUpload
This is a test to see whether if this can be synced by Azure Devops
